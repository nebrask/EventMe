## What it does

It gets harder and harder to decide what to do for fun when the weather warms up and more events become available. EventMe is an app that was created to address such issues. Our carefully designed program can evaluate user's location data to produce local events such as festivals and concerts on a map, and direct users to chosen events.  The app may be used to plan events for you and your friends entirely within the app, in addition to being able to record which events the user would like to prioritize.


## Plans for the future

- processing local weather data and recommending weather-dependent events 
- Improving UI
- Recommend events based on user's interest
- Adding a filtering system for specific events
